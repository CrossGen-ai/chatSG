# üö® CRITICAL RACE CONDITION FIX

## ‚ö†Ô∏è READ BEFORE MODIFYING ChatUI.tsx

This project contains a **critical fix** for a race condition in the multi-chat interface. 

**Problem**: Bot responses appeared in wrong chat windows when users switched chats quickly.

**Solution**: Ref-based session tracking to prevent stale closure variables.

## üîß Critical Code Locations

- **File**: `frontend/src/components/ChatUI.tsx`
- **Key sections**: Lines with `üö® CRITICAL: DO NOT REMOVE` comments
- **Full documentation**: `frontend/RACE_CONDITION_FIX_DOCUMENTATION.md`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING

**DO NOT REMOVE** any code marked with `üö® CRITICAL` comments without:
1. Reading the full documentation
2. Understanding the race condition implications  
3. Testing with the documented test procedure

## üß™ Test Procedure

1. Send message in Chat A
2. Quickly switch to Chat B  
3. Stay in Chat B until response arrives
4. Verify response does NOT appear in Chat B
5. Switch back to Chat A
6. Verify response IS in Chat A

**If the test fails, the race condition has returned.**
