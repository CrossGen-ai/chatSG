Here is the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n- **Step 1: Identify the Numbers**: We have two numbers to add, which are 2 and 2.\n  \n- **Step 2: Apply Addition**: Addition is the process of combining two or more numbers to get a total. For these specific numbers:\n  - Start with the first 2.\n  - Add the second 2 to the first 2.\n\n- **Step 3: Calculate the Sum**: \n  - \\( 2 + 2 = 4 \\)\n\nThus, the sum of 2 + 2 is 4. This is a straightforward example of addition that does not require any additional techniques or considerations.","metadata":{"sessionId":"perf-test-fixed","agent":"AnalyticalAgent","agentType":"analytical","confidence":1,"streaming":true,"memoryStatus":{"enabled":true,"memoryCount":0,"status":"empty","retrievalTime":4052}}}
