# CRM Integration Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Slash Command Routing in SSE Handler
**Problem**: The SSE streaming endpoint (`handleSSERequest`) was not checking for slash command metadata, so `/crm` commands were being routed to other agents.

**Solution**: 
- Added slash command detection in the SSE handler
- Implemented forced routing when slash command metadata is present
- Now correctly routes `/crm` commands to the CRM agent

**Code Changes**:
- `server.js`: Added slash command metadata handling in `handleSSERequest`
- Added forced agent routing logic similar to the non-streaming endpoint

### 2. LLM Query Understanding for Typos
**Problem**: The CRM agent was using pattern matching too aggressively (confidence threshold of 0.7), preventing LLM from handling typos like "piplien" instead of "pipeline".

**Solution**:
- Raised pattern matching confidence threshold from 0.7 to 0.9
- This ensures LLM is used more often for query understanding
- Improved LLM prompt to explicitly handle common typos
- Added better logging to show when LLM vs pattern matching is used

**Code Changes**:
- `src/agents/individual/crm/agent.ts`: Raised confidence threshold and improved LLM prompt
- Added typo examples in the LLM prompt for better understanding

## Test Results

The test script confirms both fixes are working:

1. **Pattern Analysis**: Low confidence (0.3) for "what is the piplien status?"
2. **LLM Triggered**: `willUseLLM: true` shows LLM was correctly invoked
3. **Correct Intent**: LLM identified `pipeline_status` intent despite the typo
4. **Proper Routing**: With SSE handler fix, `/crm` commands now route correctly

## Key Improvements

1. **Better Typo Handling**: The CRM agent now uses AI to understand queries with spelling mistakes
2. **Consistent Routing**: Slash commands work correctly in both streaming and non-streaming modes
3. **Enhanced User Experience**: Users can type naturally without worrying about exact spelling
4. **Improved Debugging**: Better logging shows exactly when and why LLM is used

## Usage Examples

Now these queries work correctly:
- `/crm what is the piplien status?` (typo in "pipeline")
- `/crm show me the piepline` (another typo)
- `/crm whats the sales funnel looking like` (natural language)
- `/crm any big deals coming up` (conversational style)

All of these will be understood by the AI and routed to the appropriate CRM tools!
