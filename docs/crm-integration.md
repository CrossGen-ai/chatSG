## Architecture

### AI-Powered Query Understanding
The CRM agent now uses **AI (LLM) for intelligent query analysis**:
- **Natural language understanding** - Handles variations and typos
- **Smart parameter extraction** - Identifies emails, names, companies automatically
- **Context-aware intent detection** - Understands what you're really asking for
- **Fallback to patterns** - Uses fast pattern matching for common queries

### Workflow Stages
1. **Intake**: Process user input
2. **Query Analysis**: AI analyzes intent (with pattern matching fallback)
3. **Data Retrieval**: Fetch data from CRM API
4. **Enrichment**: Add calculated metrics and insights
5. **Response Generation**: Format results for display

### Query Intent Types
- `customer_lookup`: Search for contacts by various criteria
- `pipeline_status`: Analyze sales pipeline health
- `opportunity_details`: Get specific opportunity information
- `lead_information`: Query lead status and scoring
- `general_query`: Fallback for unmatched queries

## Security

- API keys stored in environment variables only
- No sensitive data logged
- Rate limiting prevents API abuse
- Input validation on all queries
- Secure HTTPS connections

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Failed**
   - Check INSIGHTLY_API_KEY is set correctly
   - Verify API key has necessary permissions

2. **Rate Limit Exceeded**
   - Reduce concurrent requests
   - Implement request queuing
   - Check daily API limits

3. **No Results Found**
   - Verify search criteria spelling
   - Check data exists in CRM
   - Try broader search terms

### Debug Mode
Set environment variable `DEBUG=crm:*` to enable detailed logging:
```bash
DEBUG=crm:* npm run dev
```

## Performance Considerations

- **Caching**: Contact and pipeline data cached for 5-10 minutes
- **Pagination**: Large result sets automatically paginated
- **Lazy Loading**: Tools initialized only when needed
- **Connection Pooling**: Reuses HTTP connections

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Write operations (create/update contacts)
- [ ] Custom field mapping
- [ ] Webhook integration for real-time updates
- [ ] Advanced analytics and reporting
- [ ] Multi-CRM support (Salesforce, HubSpot)
- [ ] Bulk operations
- [ ] Export functionality
