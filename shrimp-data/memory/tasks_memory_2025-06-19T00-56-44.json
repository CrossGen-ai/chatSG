Added critical fix that loads current messages from localStorage, adds the user message, and saves immediately to the correct chat's localStorage using originatingSessionId before updating UI state.

The fix ensures user messages are always saved to the correct chat regardless of subsequent session switching. TypeScript compilation verified successful with no errors.",
