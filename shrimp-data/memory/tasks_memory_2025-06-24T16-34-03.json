Add deprecation warnings:\\n- Log warnings for old import paths\\n- Provide guidance for updating to new structure\\n- Set timeline for complete migration",
      "verificationCriteria": "All existing functionality preserved, legacy agents work through wrappers, gradual migration path documented, no breaking changes to public APIs",
      "analysisResult": "Refactor ChatSG backend from current flat agent structure to modular folder-based architecture. Each agent becomes self-contained with tools, memory, config, and UI components. Support both individual agent operation and LangGraph-based agency coordination. Enable isolated development where coding agents can work on specific agent folders without breaking other components. Maintain TypeScript patterns and backward compatibility throughout transition.",
      "summary": "Migration and backward compatibility successfully implemented. Created comprehensive legacy compatibility layer that maintains 100% API compatibility while providing smooth migration path. All existing AgentZero and AgentRouter imports continue to work without modification. Implemented deprecation warnings, comprehensive migration documentation, and gradual migration strategy. Original agent files backed up and replaced with compatibility shims. Zero breaking changes achieved while enabling future migration to modular TypeScript architecture.",
