Extend StateManager to support cross-session memory queries:\\n   - Add queryStates method with user-based filtering\\n   - Implement memory sharing between sessions for same user\\n   - Create memory isolation when cross-session is disabled\\n2. Modify agent memory systems to check crossSessionMemory preference\\n3. Implement memory context injection:\\n   - When crossSessionMemory is enabled, inject relevant context from other sessions\\n   - Limit context size to prevent performance issues\\n   - Prioritize recent and relevant memories\\n4. Add cross-session memory indicators in UI\\n5. Create memory cleanup and privacy controls\\n6. Implement user-based memory namespacing for future multi-user support",

The implementation provides memory context sharing when enabled, maintains memory isolation when disabled, includes performance optimizations with size limits and relevance scoring, and integrates seamlessly with existing chat settings. The cross-session memory indicator is displayed in the chat header when enabled, and the system prepares for multi-user architecture with user-based memory namespacing.",
